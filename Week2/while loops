While loops begin by testing a condtion. 
If it is true, then they execute the loop body. 
Once the loop body is executed, the condition is teseted again, and forth. 

count <-0
while(count <10){
print(count)
count <-count +1 
} 

You have to make sure the condition stops eventually 

z <-5
while(z>=3 && x<=10){
print(z) 
coin <-rbinom(1,1,0.5)

if(coin==1){ ##random walk
z <-z+1
} else { 
z <-z-1 
}
} 

condition checking always goes from left to right
