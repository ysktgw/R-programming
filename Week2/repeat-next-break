Repeat 
  -repeat initiates an infinite loop; these are not commonly used in sats apps, but they do have their uses 
  - the only way to exit a repeat loop is to call break 
  
x0 <-1
tol <-le-8

repeat{
      x1 <- computeEstimate()
      
      if(abs(x1-x0 <tol) {
        break
        } else {
              x0 <-x1
        }
     } 
     
Next 
  - next is used to skip an iteration of a loop 
  
for(i in 1:100){
        if(i <=20){
          ## Skip the first 20 iterations 
            next
            }
            ## do something else here
        } 
        

Return tells that a functions should exit and return a given value
