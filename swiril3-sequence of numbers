Sequence of Numbers

backtrick key ` is located just below Esc key 
?`operator`

seq(1,20) == 1:20

for increment, add by=0.5 
for length, add length=30 

seq(5,10, lenth=30)

my_seq <-seq(5,10, length=30)
1:length(my_seq) 
== 
seq(along.with=my_seq) 

which is not same as seq_along(my_seq) 


rep(0, times = 40) 
you can also repeat vectors 
rep(c(0,1,2), times=10) 




also you could do 
rep(c(0,1,2), each=10) 
to get 10 zeros, and then 10 ones, etc
