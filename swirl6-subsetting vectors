x[1:10] shows the first 10 elements of x
[index vector] 


index vector- logical, positive integers, negative integers, character strings 

x[!is.na(x)] gives you all the non-NA values from x

x[!is.na(x)& x>0]

R is 'one-based indexing'-first element of a vector is considered as 1 

R doesn't stop you from asking for out of the bounds so beaware! 

x[c(2,10)] 
x[c(-2, -10)] gives you all elements of x except for 2nd and 10th x
== x[-c(2,10)]

you can name elements; 
vect <-c(foo=11, bar=2) 

or you can add `names` attributes
names(vect2) <-c("foo", "bar")
